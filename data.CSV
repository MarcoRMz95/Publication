An important debate has recently opened at an international level on the role of β-casein (β-CN) A1 and A2 polymorphisms, toward human health. For this reason, a lot of efforts has been put into the promotion of A2 milk by companies producing and selling A1-free milk, leading the farmers and breeders to switch toward A2 milk production without paying attention on the potential effect of the processability of milk into cheese. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of β-CN, specifically the A1 and A2 allelic variants, on the detailed milk protein profile and cheese-making traits in individual milk samples of 1,133 Holstein Friesian cows. The protein fractions were measured with reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC (expressed in g/L and % N), and the …

Somatic cell count (SCC) is the most widely used means of assessing udder health status. However, differential somatic cell count (DSCC) has recently been proposed as a new and more effective means of evaluating intramammary infection dynamics. Differential SCC represents the combined percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes (PMN-LYM) in the total SCC, with macrophages (MAC) accounting for the remaining proportion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between SCC and DSCC and the detailed milk protein profile in a population of 1,482 Holstein cows. A validated reversed-phase HPLC method was used to quantify 4 caseins (CN), namely αS1-CN, αS2-CN, κ-CN, and β-CN, and 3 whey protein fractions, namely β-lactoglobulin, α …

To allow the prompt detection of metabolic dysfunction with noninvasive and ready-to-use methods on the farm, milk matrix represents the best option. Among milk fine components, the fatty acid profile represents a fingerprint of the cow’s nutritional and metabolic status, being a suitable indicator of metabolic imbalance at the cow level. We performed an association study between milk fatty acid profile and a set of metabolic indicators, such as body condition score, ultrasound liver measurements, and blood metabolites, from 297 Holstein–Friesian cows. We extracted a few latent variables able to explain specific biological mechanisms from the milk fatty acid profile. Then, we explored the associations between these new synthetic variables, namely the factors, and the morphometric, ultrasonographic and hematic indicators of immune and metabolic status. The significant associations of fatty acid factors with blood and ultrasound indicators of inflammation and hepatic load showed the capacity of fatty acids to reflect the energy metabolic status of lactating cows, suggesting their potential usefulness as markers of digestive alterations and metabolic variations in cows during the critical period of early lactation.

Although milk is increasingly used for cheese production, the cheese-making efficiency of milk from the different species is not well known. This study compares the cheese-making ability of milk sampled from lactating females of the 6 dairy species in terms of milk composition, coagulation properties (using lactodynamography), curd-firming modeling, nutrients recovered in the curd, and cheese yield (through laboratory model-cheese production). Equine (donkey) milk had the lowest fat and protein content and did not coagulate after rennet addition.

This practice provides additional forage supply for mountain dairy farms and plays a role in the preservation of landscape, biodiversity, and natural habitats and conservation of local traditional dairy products, but it may affect cows’ physiological and nutritional status. This study aimed to investigate the effects of transhumance of Brown Swiss cows to summer pastures on the yield, composition, and coagulation properties of milk, and on cheese yield. For this study, twelve multiparous cows from a mountain lowland permanent farm were divided into two groups of six cows: One group stayed at the permanent farm while the other moved to the alpine pasture (1860 m above sea level). Cows at the alpine pasture had reduced milk yield and body condition, and greater fat and lower protein contents in milk compared to cows at the permanent farm. Conversely, neither milk coagulation properties nor cheese yield were affected by summer transhumance. In conclusion, summer transhumance did not affect the cheese making efficiency of milk compared to permanent farm, but the negative effect on milk yield depressed daily cheese yield, which was 2 kg/d lower in cows moved to Alpine pasture.

Local breeds, including donkey breeds that have lost their primary function, are often existentially endangered and require reintegration into alternative economic utilization programs. Donkey meat and particularly donkey milk have attracted consumer interest due to their nutritional and functional value. This research focused on the production and quality indicators of donkey meat and milk, aiming to establish and optimize sustainable economic utilization programs for donkeys. This approach represents the most effective strategy for long-term in situ conservation programs of endangered local donkey breeds in their natural habitats. The research outcomes provide a solid basis for the development of similar programs for other local donkey breeds.

The objective of this study was to characterize the major sources of variation in the absorbance of the infrared spectrum in caprine milk samples. A total of 657 goats belonging to 6 breeds and reared on 20 farms under traditional and modern dairy systems were milk-sampled once. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken (2 replicates per sample, 1314 spectra), and each spectrum contained absorbance values at 1060 different wavenumbers (5000 to 930 × cm−1), which were treated as a response variable and analyzed one at a time (i.e., 1060 runs). A mixed model, including the random effects of sample/goat, breed, flock, parity, stage of lactation, and the residual, was used. The pattern and variability of the FTIR spectrum of caprine milk was similar to those of bovine milk. The major sources of variation in the entire spectrum were as follows: sample/goat (33% of the total variance); flock (21%); breed (15%); lactation stage (11%); parity (9%); and the residual unexplained variation (10%). The entire spectrum was segmented into five relatively homogeneous regions. Two of them exhibited very large variations, especially the residual variation. These regions are known to be affected by the absorbance of water, although they also exhibited wide variations in the other sources of variation.

As the first step in a large project, our aim was to characterize and quantify the major sources of variation in cheese characteristics by sampling 1050 different cheeses manufactured by over 100 producers and grouped into 37 categories (16 with protected designation of origin, 4 traditional cheese categories, 3 pasta filata cheese categories, 5 flavored cheese categories, 2 goat milk categories, and 7 other categories ranging from very fresh to very hard cheeses). We obtained 17 traits from each cheese (shape, height, diameter, weight, moisture, fat, protein, water soluble nitrogen, ash, pH, 5 color traits, firmness, and adhesiveness). The main groups of cheese categories were characterized and are discussed in terms of the effects of the prevalent area of origin/feeding system, species of lactating females, main cheese-making technologies, and additives used. The results will allow us to proceed with the further steps, which will address the interrelationships among the different traits characterizing cheeses, detailed analyses of the nutrients affecting human health and sensorial fingerprinting.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contribute in large part to the flavor of meat, and while increasing numbers of articles are published on this topic, reviews of these articles are very scarce. Therefore, our aim was to perform a bibliometric analysis of the scientific publications on VOCs in meat over the period 2000–2020. We selected 611 scientific sources from the Scopus database related to VOCs in meat (seafood excluded). The bibliometric information retrieved included journals, authors, countries, institutions, keywords, and citations. From this analysis, we drew up a list of the most important journals, authors, countries, and institutions, and the trends in VOC research on meat. We conducted a social network analysis (SNA) to identify the collaborations among the many authors and countries, and a keyword analysis to generate a network map of the authors’ keywords. We also determined which meat species were most frequently chosen as research subjects, traced the evolution of the various methods/instruments used, and explored the research tendencies. Finally, we point out the need for further research in defining meat quality, improving meat flavor, identifying adulterants, and certifying the authenticity of meat.

The aim of this study was to investigate breed effect on the detailed protein profile of goat milk. This research is part of the GOOD-MILK project which involved 1,272 goats from 6 different breeds reared in 35 farms located in Sardinia (Italy). The breeds are divided in two categories: the Alpine breeds (ALP: Camosciata delle Alpi and Saanen); and the Mediterranean breeds (MED: Murciano-Granadina, Maltese, Sarda, and Sarda Primitiva). A total of 1,090 individual milk samples from 23 farms (823 samples + 267 duplicates) were analysed for identification and quantification of milk protein fractions by RP-HPLC method. The data were analysed using a linear mixed model with the classes of days in milk (DIM), parity, and breed as fixed effects, while the flock effect was included as random. In a second model, the fixed effects of casein genotypes were also included. Breed affected all milk protein fractions, while DIM and parity had small effects. The main differences in protein profile among breeds were between ALP and MED types, being the former richer in whey proteins and lower in caseins than the latter; within MED, Sarda and Sarda Primitiva showed higher concentration in caseins than the other breeds, and no significant differences from each other. The inclusion of casein genotypes did not change relevantly the breed effect estimates but it decreased the residual variance, especially for αS1- and β-caseins.

Bovine milk is the most commonly consumed milk worldwide, but in some areas of the world milk from other species represents an important contribution to the overall consumption. This study aimed to compare the detailed mineral profile of milk from cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep, dromedary camels, and donkeys and the minerals recovery in their cheese. Ten 2-liter samples of bulk milk were collected from different Italian farms for donkey, cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep species, while 10 milk samples were collected from dromedary camels reared in two different areas in Algeria. We processed the samples individually using the same model cheese-making procedure and the wheels obtained were ripened for 95 ± 5 d in the same conditions (15 °C and 85% RH). Samples of milk and ripened cheese were analyzed for the detailed mineral profile using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). The percentage of milk minerals recovery in cheese was also calculated. Milk minerals and their recovery in cheese were analyzed using a generalized linear model, where the species was considered as a fixed effect. The results showed that donkey milk had the lowest concentration of macro- and micro-minerals except for Sr. Considering the macro-mineral profile, the dromedary milk had the highest concentration of Na and was similar to the cow’s and goat’s milk in terms of Ca, K, P, and S, but it was more similar to the donkey milk in terms of Mg. Compared to the bubaline and ovine milk, cow and goat showed a lower content of many macro- minerals but …

Malga cheese is made with raw cow’s milk and is characterized by a peculiar flavour. Our aim was to investigate milk microbiota in summer pasture and in autumn, after the transhumance, in lowland during indoor farming and to characterize milk composition, cheese-making properties and quality. The project involved 4 permanent farms (PF) moving the cows on 4 summer farms located at Passo Vezzena (Trentino). Milk samples were collected in mid-July in Malga, from 26 Italian Simmental cows (5-7 per farm), and in mid-October, during lowland indoor feeding based on hay and compound feed. Each milk sample was investigated for the total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, for the technological potential (lactic acid bacteria, LAB), presence of putative healthy bacteria (bifidobacteria, propionibacteria) and pathogenic bacteria (coliforms, haemolytic streptococci, prototheca). Over 200 bacterial isolates from MRS, MRS-cys, YELA, and WC plates were considered for the identification by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Individual milk samples were also analysed for microbiota composition by Miseq Illumina, milk composition, milk coagulation properties, nutrient recovery in curd, cheese yield and composition. The data were analysed with a mixed model including the fixed effects of farm, period and their interaction, and the random effects of individual cows and residual. The results revealed high variability among milk plate counts. Coliform, LAB, total bacterial counts, propionibacteria …

Positive influences can be obtained for the environment, society, tourism, animal health and welfare. The aim of this study was to analyze the evolution of the milk microbiota before, during, and after summer transhumance to highland pasture in relation to possible effects on animal/human health and cheese-making properties. The study involved 12 healthy, multiparous, mid-lactation Brown Swiss cows reared in a farm located in the Trento province (Northern East Italy). The cows were monitored from June to October and divided into two groups: six cows were used as a control group and kept in the lowland permanent farm (PF); the other six cows were moved to a temporary alpine farm (ALP) from July to September. From each milk, samples were collected every four weeks for genomic DNA extraction and microbiota characterization using community 16S rRNA amplicon (V3–V4 region) based Illumina Miseq sequencing and QIIME2 (2018.2 version). The relative abundance was analyzed after a log10 transformation and identified species were classified into two unfavorable categories: Spoilage and Pathogenic species, and two favorable categories: Probiotics and Dairy species. For the statistical analysis, we used a linear mixed model, where the combined Month× Group (MG) effect was used as fixed and the cow effect as random. The results revealed a different behavior in the ALP group compared to the PF group during the 3 months of summer transhumance. The Spoilage bacteria tended to …

The caseins (αs1-, αs2-, β- e κ-casein) and whey proteins (α-lactalbumin, β -lactoglobulin) are the same as in bovine milk but their genetic variants are different because of different polymorphisms at these loci. The aim of this study was to quantify the protein fractions and concurrently to identify their genetic variants developing a method based on Reverse-Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). This project involved 1,272 goats from 6 different breeds reared in 35 farms located in Sardinia (Italy). Individual milk samples were analysed for milk composition, coagulation, curd firming and syneresis, cheese yield and milk nutrients recovery in curd. To quantify the content of protein fractions of different genetic variants, freeze-dried protein samples of milk previously genotyped for genetic variants were used for calibration of HPLC since commercial standards are not available for goat milk. Five variants of αs1-casein (A, B, E, F and null; CSN1S1 gene; 11 genotypes), 2 variants of αs2-casein (A/F and C; CSN1S2 gene; 3 genotypes), 3 variants for β-casein (A, C, and null; CSN2 gene; 4 genotypes) and 5 variants for κ-casein (A, B, C, D, and null; CSN3 gene; 8 genotypes) were identified and quantified by HPLC. The statistical analysis of preliminary data revealed that polymorphisms in goat milk proteins have strong effects on the concentration of different caseins and on milk coagulation, curd firming, cheese yield and nutrient …

The aim of the present work was to study the effect of the CSN2, CSN3 and BLG genes on the major protein fractions (αs1-CN, αs2-CN, β-CN, κ-CN, β-LG, α-LA), expressed qualitatively as percentage of total nitrogen content (%N) and quantitatively as content in milk (g/l). A total of 1,264 Brown Swiss cows were sampled individually in 85 commercial herds in North-East Italy, and 989 cows were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 v.2 BeadChip, from which 37,519 SNP markers were used. The Reversed-Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography was used for quantifying the content of the six major milk protein fractions, with β-CN, κ-CN and β-LG genetic variants being quantified separately. The protein fractions were analysed using a Bayesian animal model implemented via Gibbs sampling. Effects of days in milk, parity order and the CSN2, CSN3 and BLG genotypes were assigned flat priors; herd and animal additive effects were assigned Gaussian prior distributions. Marginal posterior distributions of parameters of interest were compared between the standard animal model and the mixed inheritance model (i.e. the one with the protein loci included in the model). Results indicated that a considerable portion of the genetic variance was explained by the effect of the three major genes for most of the protein fractions. In particular, the CSN2, CSN3 and BLG genotypes affected not only the proteins they codify for, but also the synthesis of the other protein fractions. For the CSN genes …

A total of 1500 dairy cows belonging to 6 breeds (3 specialised dairy breeds: Holstein-Friesian, Brown Swiss, Jersey; and 3 dual-purpose breeds: Simmental, Alpine Grey, Rendena) were sampled from 41 multi-breed herds (from 2 to 5 breeds per herd) located in Trentino-Alto Adige region (Northeast Italy). High- Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) permitted the quantification of all the major protein fractions and the identification of β-CN, κ-CN and β-LG genetic variants. Protein fractions were analysed using a linear mixed model, which considered breed, parity, DIM, and CSN2, CSN3, BLG genotypes as fixed effects, herd as random effect and herd productivity as covariate. Results showed that parity and DIM influenced all protein fractions, both expressed as g/L and %N. Also, the genotypes of CSN2, CSN3 and BLG affected almost all the traits considered. Even after correcting for the effects of the protein genotypes, breed of cows showed large differences: Holstein-Friesian cows had the lowest milk protein content, but with the highest proportion of true protein, mainly because of a high proportion of β-CN and whey protein; Jersey cows had the highest milk protein, casein and particularly αs1-CN, contents, but the lowest proportion of true protein and content of whey proteins; Brown Swiss and Simmental cows showed intermediate results …

Ten bulk milk samples (2.0 l each) per species were collected from different Italian farms for cattle, buffalo, goat and sheep species, while 10 milk samples were collected from dromedaries reared in two Algerian areas. We processed the milk to assess, and analyze using mixed models: (1) milk composition; (2) milk coagulation properties, through lactodynamography with two replicates per sample; (3) curd firming and syneresis equation parameters, through modelling of 240 point measures from each replicate; (4)% cheese-yield traits, through individual model-cheese procedure on each milk sample; (5) milk nutrients recovery in curd, from cheese-making. Dromedary milk presented (mixed model): a fat and protein content not different from bovine, and caprine milk, but smaller than bubaline and ovine milk; a coagulation time interval after rennet addition (LSM: 13.9 min) about half than bovine milk and similar to other dairy species; a potential curd firmness (41.4 mm) and a curd firming rate (9.5%/min) similar to bovine milk, but a greater syneresis rate (1.9%/min) and then a much lower maximum curd firmness (17.8 mm) measured 36.2 min after rennet addition. The cheese yield of dromedary milk (13.8%) was lower than that of buffaloes (25.7%) and ewes (23.2%), and intermediate to that of cows (15.2%) and goats (11.9%).

The study involved 12 multiparous Brown Swiss cows kept in a mountain herd (permanent farm, PF) allotted in two groups of 6 cows each. Cows of a group remained in the PF, the others were moved (July to September) to a temporary summer farm (TF, 1860 m asl). Daily milk yield (MY), BCS and individual milk sample (2000 mL per cow) were collected monthly from June to October. Milk samples were assessed for fat and protein (PRT) content, milk coagulation properties (rennet coagulation time, curd firming rate and firmness) and cheese yield through individual model cheese-making. Model of analysis included the month x group combination as fixed and the animal as random effect, to examine the pattern of traits across months in PF group and the difference of TF vs PF group by month. Cows kept in PF evidenced from June to October a decrease in MY, an increase of fat and PRT content of milk, an improvement of milk coagulation properties and an increase of cheese yield traits, mostly according to a curvilinear (quadratic or cubic) pattern of change consistent with that expected considering the advancement of the stage of lactation. When compared to cows kept in PF, those moved to TF evidenced a greater depression of MY (P< 0.01) and BCS, retained also at the return to PF in October, a greater fat and a smaller PRT content in the first two months of summer pasture (P< 0.05). Conversely, neither milk coagulation properties nor cheese yield and milk nutrient recovery in curd were affected by temporary summer …

Pathway analyses revealed that 12:0 was associated with the greatest number of overrepresented categories/pathways (e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and protein phosphorylation), suggesting that it might play an important biological role in controlling milk fat composition. An Associated Weight Matrix approach based on SNP co-associations predicted a network of 791 genes related to the milk FA profile …

Also, mutations originally described as somatic aberrations have been shown to confer cancer predisposition when occurring in the germline. The relevance of mutations in canine B-cell lymphoma is scarcely known and gene expression profiling has shown similar molecular signatures among different B-cell histotypes, suggesting other biological mechanisms underlining differences. Here, we present a highly accurate approach to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA-seq data obtained from 62 completely staged canine B-cell lymphomas and 11 normal B-cells used as controls. A customized variant discovery pipeline was applied and SNVs were found in tumors and differentiated for histotype. A number of known and not previously identified SNVs were significantly associated to MAPK signaling pathway, negative regulation of apoptotic process and cell death, B-cell activation, NF-kB and JAK-STAT signaling. Interestingly, no significant genetic fingerprints were found separating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from indolent lymphomas suggesting that differences of genetic landscape are not the pivotal causative factor of indolent behavior. We also detected several variants in expressed regions of canine B-cell lymphoma and identified SNVs having a direct impact on genes. Using this brand-new approach the consequence of a gene variant is directly associated to expression. Further investigations are in progress to deeply elucidate the mechanisms by which …

In Italy, an increase in GC-positive cases has been observed in cattle since 2008, particularly prednisolone (PDN). Recent studies clearly demonstrate that both histopathological analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS–MS) were unable to detect PDN treatments. The aim of this study was to identify transcriptomic signatures of PDN administration in the thymus of experimentally treated animals by comparison with untreated controls, in order to identify gene expression changes or pathways alteration induced by the corticosteroid treatment. Microarray data analysis showed substantial modifications in thymus gene expression profiles after PDN treatment. Several of the 388 …

To assess different sources of variation, especially the cows' breed and genetic variants of the main protein fractions, milk samples were collected from 1,504 cows belonging to 3 dairy breeds (Holstein-Friesian, Brown Swiss, and Jersey) and 3 dual-purpose breeds (Simmental, Rendena, and Alpine Grey) reared in 41 multibreed herds. Beyond crude protein, casein (CN), and urea, 7 protein fractions were analyzed using HPLC, and 5 other N fraction traits were calculated. All 15 traits were measured qualitatively (% of milk N) and quantitatively (g/L of milk).

An important debate has recently opened at an international level on the role of β-casein (β-CN) A1 and A2 polymorphisms, toward human health. For this reason, a lot of efforts has been put into the promotion of A2 milk by companies producing and selling A1-free milk, leading the farmers and breeders to switch toward A2 milk production without paying attention on the potential effect of the processability of milk into cheese. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of β-CN, specifically the A1 and A2 allelic variants, on the detailed milk protein profile and cheese-making traits in individual milk samples of 1,133 Holstein Friesian cows. The protein fractions were measured with reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC (expressed in g/L and % N), and the …

It results in changes in milk composition and quality which are indicators of udder inflammation in absence of clinical signs. We applied structural equation modeling (SEM) - GWAS aiming to explore interrelated dependency relationships among phenotypes related to udder health, including milk yield (MY), somatic cell score (SCS), lactose (%, LACT), pH and non-casein N (NCN, % of total milk N), in a cohort of 1,158 Brown Swiss cows. The phenotypic network inferred via the Hill-Climbing algorithm was used to estimate SEM parameters. Integration of multi-trait models-GWAS and SEM-GWAS identified six significant SNPs for SCS, and quantified the contribution of MY and LACT acting as mediator traits to total SNP effects. Functional analyses revealed that overrepresented pathways were often shared among traits and were consistent with …

Calibration equations are often developed using standard methods, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression. Methods that employ penalization, rank-reduction, and variable selection, as well as being able to model the nonlinear relations between phenotype and FTIR, might offer improvements in predictive ability and model robustness. This study aimed to compare the predictive ability of 2 machine learning methods, namely random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM), and penalized regression against PLS regression for predicting 3 phenotypes differing in terms of biological meaning and relationships with milk composition (i.e., phenotypes measurable directly and not directly in milk, reflecting different biological processes …

The use of transcriptomic markers has already proposed to identify indirect evidence of anabolic hormone treatment. So far, such approach has been tested in experimentally treated animals. Here, for the first time commercial samples were analyzed. Quantitative determination of Dexamethasone (DEX) residues in the urine collected at the slaughterhouse was performed by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). DNA-microarray technology was used to obtain transcriptomic profiles of skeletal muscle in commercial samples and negative controls. LC-MS confirmed the presence of low level of DEX residues in the urine of the commercial samples suspect for histological classification. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on microarray data identified two clusters of samples. One cluster included negative controls and a subset of commercial samples, while a second cluster included part of the specimens collected at the slaughterhouse together with positives for corticosteroid treatment based on thymus histology and LC-MS. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes (3961) between the two groups provided further evidence that animals clustering with positive samples might have been treated with corticosteroids. These suspect samples could be reliably classified with a specific classification tool (Prediction Analysis of Microarray) using just two genes. Despite broad variation observed in gene expression profiles, the present study showed that DNA-microarrays can be used to find transcriptomic signatures of putative anabolic …

Records were available from 1,123 cows phenotyped using gold standard laboratory methodologies (LAB data). This included phenotypes related to fine milk composition and milk technological characteristics, milk acidity, and milk protein fractions. The dataset used to generate FTIR predictions comprised 729,202 test-day records from 51,059 Brown Swiss cows (FIELD data). A first approach consisted of estimating genetic parameters for phenotypes available from LAB and FIELD datasets. To do so, a set of bivariate animal models were run, and genetic correlations between LAB and FIELD phenotypes were estimated using FIELD information obtained at the population level. Heritability estimates were generally higher for FIELD predictions than for the corresponding LAB measures. The additive genetic correlations (ra) between LAB and FIELD phenotypes had different magnitudes across traits but were generally strong. Overall, these results demonstrated the potential of using FIELD information as indicator traits for the indirect genetic improvement of LAB measures.

A larger trial has been carried out in which animals were fed with different diets: 1] a conventional diet; 2] a low-protein/low-mineral diet (low-impact diet) and 3] a diet enriched in n-3 fatty acids (FAs), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vitamin E (nutraceutical diet). The initial hypothesis was that the administration of low-impact and nutraceutical diets might influence the transcriptional profiles in bovine liver and the resultant nutrient fluxes, which are essential for optimal liver function and nutrient interconversion. Results showed that the nutraceutical diet significantly reduced subcutaneous fat covering in vivo and liver pH. Dietary treatments did not affect overall liver fat content, but significantly modified the liver profile of 33 FA traits (out of the total 89 identified by gas-chromatography). In bulls fed nutraceutical diet, the percentage of n-3 and CLA FAs increased around 2.5-fold compared with the other diets, whereas the ratio of n6/n3 decreased 2.5-fold. Liver transcriptomic analyses revealed a total of 198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when comparing low-impact, nutraceutical and conventional diets, with the nutraceutical diet showing the greatest effects on liver transcriptome.

Genomic data might help predict these phenotypes when integrated with milk FTIR spectra. The objective of this study was to investigate prediction accuracy for milk protein phenotypes when heterogeneous on-farm, genomic, and pedigree data were integrated with the spectra. To this end, we used the records of 966 Italian Brown Swiss cows with milk FTIR spectra, on-farm information, medium-density genetic markers, and pedigree data. True and total whey protein, and five casein, and two whey protein traits were analyzed. Multiple kernel learning constructed from spectral and genomic (pedigree) relationship matrices and multilayer BayesB assigning separate priors for FTIR and markers were benchmarked against a baseline partial least squares (PLS) regression. Seven combinations of covariates were considered, and their predictive abilities were evaluated by repeated random sub-sampling and herd cross-validations (CV). Addition of the on-farm effects such as herd, days in milk, and parity to spectral data improved predictions as compared to those obtained using the spectra alone. Integrating genomics and/or the top three markers with a large effect further enhanced the predictions. Pedigree data also improved prediction, but to a lesser extent than genomic data.

The selection of cows for milk protein fractions may, therefore, improve both the nutritional and technological characteristics of milk, and, consequently, the processing efficiency and value of the dairy product. This study estimated the genetic parameters of the major milk protein fractions (four caseins, and two whey proteins) determined variously as: (i) milk content (g/100g milk), (ii) percentage of milk nitrogen (%N) and (iii) daily yield (g/d) in Brown Swiss dairy cattle. The results showed that the (co)variances and genetic parameter estimates differed according to how the proteins were measured. These results provide useful information for developing selection strategies in dairy cattle breeding programs aimed at improving both the nutritional and technological properties of milk.

The aim of this study was to identify morphological or biomolecular alterations induced by prednisolone (PDN) in experimentally treated beef cattle, because PDN and its metabolites are no longer detectable by LC-MS/MS methods in biological fluids. Moreover, PDN does not induce any histological alterations in the thymus, different from dexamethasone treatments. Therefore, a marker of illicit treatment for this growth promoter could be useful. Eight male Italian Friesian beef cattle were administered prednisolone acetate 30 mg day–1 per os for 35 days, and seven beef cattle represented the control group. Six days after drug withdrawal, the animals were slaughtered. Morphological and morphometric modifications were evaluated in the epididymis and testis, whereas transcriptomic …

Somatic cell count (SCC) is the most widely used means of assessing udder health status. However, differential somatic cell count (DSCC) has recently been proposed as a new and more effective means of evaluating intramammary infection dynamics. Differential SCC represents the combined percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes (PMN-LYM) in the total SCC, with macrophages (MAC) accounting for the remaining proportion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between SCC and DSCC and the detailed milk protein profile in a population of 1,482 Holstein cows.

In this study, we compared different validation scenarios that involved combining specialized and dual-purpose dairy breeds in the training population FTIR predictions for three different phenotypes in the major cattle breed, i.e., Holstein cattle. Results show that the design of the training population is an important factor in improving predictive ability in the Holstein breed with potential implications also for the minor breeds. However, this improvement is limited by the phenotypic variability of traits of concern and spectral variability between the training and validation sets and the number of animals in the training population.

To investigate whether cow’s genetic background might contribute to cheese volatilome, we carried out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pathway–based analyses for 173 spectrometric peaks tentatively associated with several VOCs obtained from proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) analyses of 1,075 model cheeses produced using raw whole-milk from Brown Swiss cows. Overall, we detected 186 SNPs associated with 120 traits, several of which mapped close to genes involved in protein (e.g. CSN3, GNRHR and FAM169A), fat (e.g. AGPAT3, SCD5, and GPAM) and carbohydrate (e.g. B3GNT2, B4GALT1, and PHKB) metabolism.

Trivariate animal models were run, each including one fertility trait, one milk composition trait, and, in all models, milk yield. The DO and CR data were merged with the test days closest to the insemination date for milk composition traits.

This study, carried out on 306 clinically healthy Holstein cows in the first 120 d of lactation kept in 2 herds in northern Italy, aimed at investigating the association between US imaging-derived traits, namely predicted liver triacylglycerol content (pTAG, mg/g), liver depth (LD, mm), portal vein depth (PVD, mm) and area (PVA, mm2), and body size measurements, body condition score (BCS), and milk productivity indicators. Transcutaneous US examination, milk sampling, body size measurements (withers height and heart girth), and BCS were collected once from all cows in 10 sampling batches.

To allow the prompt detection of metabolic dysfunction with noninvasive and ready-to-use methods on the farm, milk matrix represents the best option. Among milk fine components, the fatty acid profile represents a fingerprint of the cow’s nutritional and metabolic status, being a suitable indicator of metabolic imbalance at the cow level. We performed an association study between milk fatty acid profile and a set of metabolic indicators, such as body condition score, ultrasound liver measurements, and blood metabolites, from 297 Holstein–Friesian cows. We extracted a few latent variables able to explain specific biological mechanisms from the milk fatty acid profile. Then, we explored the associations between these new synthetic variables, namely the factors, and the morphometric, ultrasonographic and hematic indicators of immune and metabolic status. The significant associations of fatty acid factors with blood and ultrasound indicators of inflammation and hepatic load showed the capacity of fatty acids to reflect the energy metabolic status of lactating cows, suggesting their potential usefulness as markers of digestive alterations and metabolic variations in cows during the critical period of early lactation.

Working with high larval densities requires the use of aeration systems to provide optimal larval suspension and feed distribution. The high susceptibility of the great scallop to aeration in small-volume systems may impose an important limitation in hatchery-based practices. The present study aimed to investigate the processes impacted by aeration in P. maximus veliger larvae exposed to continuous aeration in small-volume tanks (10 L).

Local dual-purpose breeds have rarely been the focus of such studies; recently, however, their value as a possible alternative to intensively farmed breeds has become clear, especially for their greater adaptability to environmental change and potential for survival in less productive areas. We performed single-step GWAS and post-GWAS analysis for body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), carcass fleshiness (CF) and dressing percentage (DP) in 1690 individuals of local alpine cattle breed, Rendena. This breed is typical of alpine pastures, with a marked dual-purpose attitude and good genetic diversity. Moreover, we considered two of the target phenotypes (BW and ADG) at different times in the individuals’ life, a potentially important aspect in the study of the traits’ genetic architecture. We identified 8 significant and 47 suggestively associated SNPs, located in 14 autosomal chromosomes (BTA). Among the strongest signals, 3 significant and 16 suggestive SNPs were associated with ADG and were located on BTA10 (50-60 Mb), while the hotspot associated with CF and DP was on BTA18 (55-62 MB). Among the significant SNPs some were mapped within genes, such as SLC12A1, CGNL1, PRTG (ADG), LOC513941 (CF), NLRP2 (CF and DP), CDC155 (DP).

Transcriptomic analysis can help in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying equine asthma. To date, the great majority of gene expression studies on equine airway diseases have focused on the analysis of only a few candidate genes, hampering robust conclusions about EA pathogenesis. In the present study, the employment of an immune-specific horse array on SEA and MEA-affected horses helped to comprehensively define their transcriptomic fingerprints. For both diseases, findings suggest that the increased amount of mucus in the airways is due to mucociliary clearance reduction rather than mucus hypersecretion. In addition, excessive complement activation might be responsible for tissue injury. Other biological pathways, mainly those involved in the perpetuation of chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling similar to human asthma, are characteristic of SEA.

Given that these analyses are time-consuming, expensive, and stressful for the cows, there has been increased interest in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of milk samples as a rapid, cost-effective alternative for predicting metabolic disturbances. The integration of FTIR data with other layers of information such as genomic and on-farm data (days in milk (DIM) and parity) has been proposed to further enhance the predictive ability of statistical methods. Here, we developed a phenotype prediction approach for a panel of blood metabolites based on a combination of milk FTIR data, on-farm data, and genomic information recorded on 1150 Holstein cows, using BayesB and gradient boosting machine (GBM) models, with tenfold, batch-out and herd-out cross-validation (CV) scenarios. The predictive ability of these approaches was measured by the coefficient of determination (R2). The results show that, compared to the model that includes only FTIR data, integration of both on-farm (DIM and parity) and genomic information with FTIR data improves the R2 for blood metabolites across the three CV scenarios, especially with the herd-out CV: R2 values ranged from 5.9 to 17.8% for BayesB, from 8.2 to 16.9% for GBM with the tenfold random CV, from 3.8 to 13.5% for BayesB and from 8.6 to 17.5% for GBM with the batch-out CV, and from 8.4 to 23.0% for BayesB and from 8.1 to 23.8% for GBM with the herd-out CV.

The aim of this study was to investigate breed effect on the detailed protein profile of goat milk. This research is part of the GOOD-MILK project which involved 1,272 goats from 6 different breeds reared in 35 farms located in Sardinia (Italy). The breeds are divided in two categories: the Alpine breeds (ALP: Camosciata delle Alpi and Saanen); and the Mediterranean breeds (MED: Murciano-Granadina, Maltese, Sarda, and Sarda Primitiva). A total of 1,090 individual milk samples from 23 farms (823 samples + 267 duplicates) were analysed for identification and quantification of milk protein fractions by RP-HPLC method. The data were analysed using a linear mixed model with the classes of days in milk (DIM), parity, and breed as fixed effects, while the flock effect was included as random. In a second model, the fixed effects of casein genotypes were also included. Breed affected all milk protein fractions, while DIM and parity had small effects. The main differences in protein profile among breeds were between ALP and MED types, being the former richer in whey proteins and lower in caseins than the latter; within MED, Sarda and Sarda Primitiva showed higher concentration in caseins than the other breeds, and no significant differences from each other. The inclusion of casein genotypes did not change relevantly the breed effect estimates but it decreased the residual variance, especially for αS1- and β-caseins.

Il modo più naturale di allevare i vitelli sarebbe lasciarli a contatto con le madri fino allo svezzamento spontaneo. Nella maggior parte degli allevamenti di bovini da latte, i vitelli vengono precocemente allontanati dalle vacche e alimentati in modo artificiale per aumentare la quota di latte da destinare al consumo umano e monitorare meglio l’alimentazione dei vitelli. Sebbene questi sistemi siano ormai consolidati e generalmente funzionino bene, impediscono lo sviluppo del naturale legame materno e possono portare a risultati negativi sia sulla crescita e sul benessere dei vitelli, sia sulla produttività e sulla salute della vacca. Infatti, alcuni studi scientifici hanno dimostrato che la resa e la composizione del latte possono essere migliorati dal più frequente svuotamento della mammella, tipico di quando si allevano i vitelli con le madri. Di conseguenza, l’allattamento naturale potrebbe aumentare la longevità e la produttività della vacca da latte.

In this context, one major operational bottleneck is the possibility to collect quality indicators over the meat and dairy chains and for selective breeding purposes. The use of near-infrared (NIR) and the Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy techniques have been proven to be powerful precision phenotyping tools for high-throughput meat and milk quality assessment. Such technologies allow scoring large number of animals and/or derived-products for novel (predicted) phenotypes and indicator traits to set-up potential new payment systems and boost the genetic improvement. One important step in the use of NIR and FTIR tools is the definition of the “gold standard” as the infrared-based predictions could act only as indicators traits. Indeed, the definition of a robust calibration set, the assessment …

The caseins (αs1-, αs2-, β- e κ-casein) and whey proteins (α-lactalbumin, β -lactoglobulin) are the same as in bovine milk but their genetic variants are different because of different polymorphisms at these loci. The aim of this study was to quantify the protein fractions and concurrently to identify their genetic variants developing a method based on Reverse-Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). This project involved 1,272 goats from 6 different breeds reared in 35 farms located in Sardinia (Italy). Individual milk samples were analysed for milk composition, coagulation, curd firming and syneresis, cheese yield and milk nutrients recovery in curd. To quantify the content of protein fractions of different genetic variants, freeze-dried protein samples of milk previously genotyped for genetic variants were used for calibration of HPLC since commercial standards are not available for goat milk. Five variants of αs1-casein (A, B, E, F and null; CSN1S1 gene; 11 genotypes), 2 variants of αs2-casein (A/F and C; CSN1S2 gene; 3 genotypes), 3 variants for β-casein (A, C, and null; CSN2 gene; 4 genotypes) and 5 variants for κ-casein (A, B, C, D, and null; CSN3 gene; 8 genotypes) were identified and quantified by HPLC. The statistical analysis of preliminary data revealed that polymorphisms in goat milk proteins have strong effects on the concentration of different caseins and on milk coagulation, curd firming, cheese yield and nutrient …
